### CCS vs CCLME extent

Spatial comparison of the California Current System (CCS) as defined by [Kahru et al. 2018](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.dsr.2018.04.007) vs California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) boundary ([see ref](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229042854_Developing_the_California_Current_Integrated_Ecosystem_Assessment_Module_I_Select_Time-Series_of_Ecosystem_State)).<br>

A coarse resolution buffer was applied from the North American Coast to delineate the CCS Transition (300 km) and Offshore (1000 km) boundaries.<br>
